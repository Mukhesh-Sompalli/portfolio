The HTML structure consists of multiple div elements, each representing different keys of a keyboard, organized into rows such as function keys, number keys, and alphabetic keys. CSS styles define the layout and appearance, including borders, box shadows, and flex properties to align keys properly. Special keys like "Backspace," "Shift," and "Space" have adjusted flex properties to span multiple key spaces. The design includes hover effects that change the background color of specific keys when hovered over. Additionally, a media query ensures responsiveness by adjusting the keyboard Is width and layout when the screen width is 600px or smaller, making it more readable on smaller devices.',

The container div is structured with an 8x8 grid, ensuring each square is evenly distributed. Each cell represents a chessboard tile, alternating between black and antiquewhite to mimic a traditional chessboard pattern. The chess pieces are represented using Font Awesome icons, placed inside specific grid cells. These icons are styled using classes like .sol and .ol, which define their color, size, and alignment to appear centered within each tile. Additionally, a media query is included to make the layout responsive for smaller screen widths, though there is a small typo (mai-width instead of min-width). This design efficiently represents a static chessboard with proper alignment of chess pieces for both players..',

The svg element is styled with a fixed width of 100px and positioned using margin properties. The radio buttons allow users to choose different speeds, each corresponding to a specific CSS transition duration. The checked radio input triggers a transformation using the CSS sibling selector (~), applying a rotate(360deg) effect to the svg element. The transition duration varies from 1 to 5 seconds depending on the selected input. However, this approach has limitations because radio buttons do not revert upon deselection, meaning the animation only triggers once per selection',
